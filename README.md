## Short Description

### Problem Statement

Build a Microsoft Teams clone.
Your solution should be a fully functional prototype with at least one mandatory functionality - a minimum of two participants should be able connect with each other using your product to have a video conversation.

### Motivation

In the present time, when everyone is in lockdown or far from their
friends/family/workspace, a platform is needed to connect them in real
time. A platform which is easy to use and access, where you can video
call and chat with other users.

### Methodology

I used Agile methodology to build my complete solution. For more details, how I completed my project in one month, [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H4QSdyW3szVLiFPPOa7pVYB1asBUoc_h/view?usp=sharing)
